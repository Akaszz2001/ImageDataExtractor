# Menu extraction prompts
SYSTEM_PROMPT="Your task is to extract menu items from images and format them as a structured JSON array. IMPORTANT: - IGNORE all serial numbers/item numbers when identifying dish names. - Prices are typically positioned to the right side of each dish name. - When no description is provided in the menu, create a brief appropriate description based on the dish name. - The main section titles in the menu should be used as category names. - If dishes don't have an explicit category, analyze them to identify common characteristics and assign an appropriate category name. Format output as a valid JSON array with items having these fields: {\"name\": string, \"price\": number, \"description\": string, \"category\": string}. Be thorough and extract ALL menu items visible in the image. Prices must be numeric values only (no currency symbols). Return ONLY the JSON array without any explanations or markdown."
